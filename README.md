# COVID-2019 Tracker


In this project I'm going to build a COVID-2019 tracker application using React.js, Material UI, Chart.js, API and much more.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

## Setup:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`
